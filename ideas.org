*THEME : Fortress*
*LIMITATION : Player must control multiple entities*

Hmmm, well does this mean at the same time or at some point?

I can't think of many games that allow multiple entity control unless it's
a CRPG or strategy game but that's different...

Well let's see, maybe we can do a "time-split" sort of dealie and still have
it work.

Have like 3 or 4 unique heroes and split a different interval of time between them
in order. This might make the game a huge PITA, or it could be interesting.

We'll explain it away with some weird entanglement spell.

Lots of powerups will definitely be needed to make the game not feel like ass.

So like a bunch of adventurers show up into a castle to conquer the big baddie,
we'll have like 4 levels or something of moderate size to be not horrible.

They are :

THE KNIGHT : Heavy defense, okay attack, not much else ,
             can break doors
(15 seconds)

THE CLERIC : Moderate defense, bad attack, but can heal themself and the rest
(15 seconds)

THE WIZARD : Low defense, faster, good attack,
also has a spell that can allow the unlocking shortcuts by controlling the
castle's obstacles (opening a draw bridge or shortcut or some loot)
(10 seconds)

THE BARBARIAN : no defense, very fast, good attack, higher jump
(10 seconds)

There will be powerups to :

DELAY THE "MIND" SWAP (+5 seconds)
FORCE THE "MIND" SWAP (to another character of choice)

and then your standard fair of hp and stuff like that.

To make the game less annoying it will have to fast paced, and the stuff
might have to be designed around having multiple entities (like puzzles that
require a person on the other side or something)

Basically the game allows you to control multiple entities but only one at a time,
which should be fair. I can't really see anything other than a party based game for that.
